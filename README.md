## Greeting

I decided to make my own version of the game of life using SDL in C. It's far to be perfect and it's kinda messy imo, though it's functional and it's what matters! I decided to treat the borders with modulo only to have one continuous space. 
I'm not sure if this is as per originally intended, thought it felt like a good choice as it enables for more interactions.

Feel free to look into the code if you're curious! I'm hoping to make a few other games using SDL in the future. This was my very very very first game and I am satisfied with it. There's a bunch of controls (l = lock, c = clear, r = run) as well as **hovering** on every chunk.

Have "fun" :3
